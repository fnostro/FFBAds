# FFBAds
---
FB has placed ads on their main website.  I don't like ads...so....

This project has the 2 files needed to build a Chrome extension:
  * manifest.json
  * FFBAds.js
  
The javascript uses the MutationObserver to look for ad criteria, and when found, hides the cuplrit.

It's a start.
This is not a compiled extension but the 2 pieces needed by Chrome to make use of their developers option on the extensions page

Copy the files locally and play.
