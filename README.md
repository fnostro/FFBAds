# FFBAds

FB has placed ads on their main website.  I don't like ads...so....

This project has the 2 files needed to build a Chrome extension:
  * manifest.json
  * FFBAds.js
  
The javascript uses the MutationObserver to look for ad criteria, and when found, hides the cuplrit.

It's a start.
This is not a compiled extension but the 2 pieces needed by Chrome to make use of their "Developer Mode" on the extensions page to "Load an unpacked extension"

Copy the files locally and play.

The folks at AdBlock are in a game of ping-pong with Facebook.  
This extension is working as og 18-Aug-2016.
